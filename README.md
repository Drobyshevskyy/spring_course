<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository contains examples from the Spring Framework and Hibernate course
<br>
<br>
It consists of three parts:
<br> 
<ul>
  <li>Spring Introduction</li>
  <li>AOP (aspect-oriented programming)</li>
  <li>Hibernate</li>
</ul>
All the projects are created with Maven
<h3>Spring Introduction</h3>
/src/spring_introduction
<br>
<br>
File Test2.java is an example of use Inversion of Controle
<br>
File Test3.java is an example of use Inversion of Controle and Dependency Injection
<br>
Interface "Pet", classes "Dog", "Cat" and "Person" are used
<br>
We use the configuration of Spring Container with .xml file. It is located at /resurces/applicationContext.xml
<br>
The examples show Dependency Injection with setters and injection of strings and other values. As not to change this values in congif file, properties file was created
<br>
Located at /resources/myApp.properties
<br>
<br>
Test4.java and Test5.java represent scope management and working with the life cycle of a bean
<br>
We use init and destroy methods of the class "Dog"
<br>
The declaration of scope, init and destroy methods is in the config file located at /resources/applicationContext2/xml
<br>
<br>
ConfigWithAnnotations1.java is an example of working with the configuration of Spring Container using small .xml config file and annotations
<br>
In .xml config file (located at /resources/applicationContext3) we only describe the scan area and everything else is marked with annotations in classes
<br>
ScopeTest.java represents operations of annotations @Scope, @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy (also with the configuration using small .xml file and annotations)
<br>
<br>
In order to implement the configuration of Spring Container using Java code we created the MyConfig.java file, all the beans and Dependency Injection are described in this file
<br>
Test6.java is an example of working with Spring Container configured with Java code
<br>
<br>
<h3>AOP (aspect-oriented programming)</h3>
/src/aop
<br>
<br>
We implement examples of aspect-oriented programming. In addition to the business logic itself, there is also the cross-cutting functionality that aspects implement
<br>
<br>
The aspects directory contains aspect-classes, differentiated by the cross-cutting logic they implement; it also contains the myPointcuts.java class (poincuts are expressions that define to which methods the logic described in "advice" will be applied)
<br>
<br>
Aspects in our aspect-classes implement end-to-end logic at various points in the execution of methods, using annotations that define this (@Before, @After, @AfterThrowing, @AfterReturning, @Around)
<br>
<br>
The test applications are developed for a school or university library, describing the process of borrowing and returning books by applying the cross-cutting functionality implemented in aspects to the main business logic
Ð˜usiness logic is implemented only in test form in order not to be distracted by its implementation, paying more attention to the implementation of cross-cutting functionality in the examples
<br>
<br>
<h3>Hibernate</h3>
Config file (/src/hibernate.cfg.xml) connects our project to mySQL
<br>
<br>
/src/hibernate_test
<br>
<br>
Java class Employee.java (/entity/Employee.java) is connected to mySQL table "employee" using Hibernate annotations 
<br>
The class has getters, setters, constuctor, fields that are equal to "employee" table columns and toString() method
<br>
<br>
Test1.java, Test2.java, Test3.java, Test4.java, Test5.java are examples of performing all the CRUD operations using SessionFactory
<br>
<br>
